# UNIST-Hitbox-Viewer

I plan to create a hitbox viewer for the fighting game Under Night In-Birth Exe:late[st], or UNIST for short. A hitbox viewer already exists for the previous version of the game, UNIEL, but an updated one has not been released due to a copyright takedown notice from the publisher ARCSYS.

The current goal for the program is to display a selection of characters and moves for the user to select. Once they select a character and a move, the program will load the appropriate image for them to view. This version of the program is severely scaled back due to the difficulty of the original scope and the lack of a response from the UNIEL version's developer.

Current sources of code for the project are found in Sources.md
