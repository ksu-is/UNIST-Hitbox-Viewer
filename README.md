# UNIST-Hitbox-Viewer

I plan to create a hitbox viewer for the fighting game Under Night In-Birth Exe:late[st], or UNIST for short. A hitbox viewer already exists for the previous version of the game, UNIEL, but an updated one has not been released due to a copyright takedown notice from the publisher ARCSYS. It may be difficult to get the code from the previous hitbox viewer, but the creator is still relatively active on Twitter, and may be receptive to helping me or my potential team, with the project.
